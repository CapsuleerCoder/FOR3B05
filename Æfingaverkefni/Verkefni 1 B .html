    <h1>Tangerine Dream</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Tangerine Dream</b> are a german electronics music group founded in 1967 by <b>Edgar Froese.</b>
        The band underwent many personnel changes over the years, with Froese being the only
        continuous member. Drummer and composer Klaus Schulze was briefly a member of an early
        lineup. The most stable version of the group, during their influential <sup>mid-1970s</sup> period, was as a 
        trio with Froses, Chrisopher Franke, and Peter Baumann. In the late 1970s, <i>Johannes Schmoelling</i> replaced <i>Baumann</i>,
        and this lineup was stable and extremely productive as well.

    <p> Although the group released numerous studio and live recordings, a substantial number of
        their fans were introduced <sub>Tangerine Dream</sub>by their film soundtracks, which total over sixty and include Sorcerer, Theif, Risky Business, The Keep, Firestarter, Legends, Near Dark, Shy People,
        and Miracle Mile. They composed the original score for the video game <b>Grand Theft Auto V.</b>

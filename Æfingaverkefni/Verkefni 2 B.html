    <h1>Texti við lagið Mull of Kintyre eftir Paul McCartney</h1>
    <p>
        Mull of Kintyre, Oh mist rolling in the from the sea <br>
        My desire is always to be here <br>
        Oh Mull of Kintyre
    </p>
    <p>
        Far have I traveled and much have I seen <br>
        Darkest of mountains with valleys of green <br>
        Past painted deserts the sun sets on fire <br>
        As he carries me home to the Mull of Kintyre
    </p>

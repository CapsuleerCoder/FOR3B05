        <span>Sir James Paul McCartney</span> CH MBE (born 18 June 1942) is an English singer, songwriter and musician who gained worldwide fame with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">Beatles</a>.
        His songwriting partnership with <span>John Lennon</span> is the most successful in modern music history.
        After the Beatles disbanded, he debuted as a solo artist with the 1970 album McCartney and went on to form the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.

        A self-taught musician, McCartney is proficient on bass, guitar, keyboards, and drums. He is known for his melodic approach to bass-playing
        (mainly playing with a plectrum), his versatile and wide tenor vocal range (spanning over four octaves), and his eclecticism (exploring styles
        ranging from pre-rock and roll pop to classical and electronica). McCartney began his career as a member of the Quarrymen in 1957, which
        evolved into the Beatles in 1960. Starting with the 1967 album <span>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</span>, he gradually became the Beatles’ de facto
        leader, providing the creative impetus for most of their music and film projects. His Beatles songs "And | Love Her" (1964), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXTJBr9tt8Q">Yesterday</a> (1965),
        "Eleanor Rigby" (1966) and "Blackbird" (1968) rank among the most covered songs in history.
